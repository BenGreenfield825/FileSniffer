# FileSniffer
This was a class project from Systems Programming

A user could enter arguments such as location to sniff, output location, verbose/case sensitive, and finally a word or phrase to search for. Sniff will traverse a file directory recursively and check text documents to see if it contained the search phrase.

The output shows what was searched and a compiled list of things found and where they were found.
